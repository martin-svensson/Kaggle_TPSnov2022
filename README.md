# Data

The original data is kept as .zip. Data is collected in a matrix for efficiency. 

# Scripts: Structure

The naming convention of scripts is as follows: [main number]-[sub number]_[file name]

The main number dictates where the script fits into the model building cycle.
The sub number is used if it is necessary to decompose the step into several subscripts. 
The file name should describe as closely as possible what the script is about
